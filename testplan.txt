We plan to test with integers.

An array is filled with numbers 0-9 in a random order.
The array is then fed as input to the SLInsert function.
The array is structured in a way such that integers
must be inserted into the front, middle and end of the list.

To test SLRemove, elements from the beginning middle and front
of the list are removed.

An iterator is then created to walk through the list and
print the data at each node.

The iterator and list are then destroyed with 
SLDestroy and SLDestroyIterator.

Throughout the testing, the list will be printed by SLPrintList
which is a function only capable of printing integers and
should only be used for testing.
